## Builder Pattern

The **Builder** design pattern is one of the **creational** design patterns. It is used in scenarios where the creation of an object becomes complex. You want to keep the **immutability** of an object and at the same time, be able to create the object with different set of attributes on different kinds of scenarios.

## Decorator Pattern

The **decorator** pattern is a structural design pattern. The main intent of the pattern is to attach additional responsibility to an object dynamically. An alternative to subclassing. I solves the problem of adding functionalities to a class without adding concrete changes to that class.


## Facade Pattern

The **facade** pattern is a **structural** design pattern. The main intent of the pattern is to provide a unified interface instead of exposing a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
