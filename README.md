## Abstract Factory Pattern

**Abstract Factory** is a **creational** design pattern. The main intent of the pattern is to allow abstraction over other factory classes.

## Prototype Pattern

The **Prototype** design pattern is one of the **creational** design patterns. Iy is very useful in scenarios where the creation of an object can become expensive.

## Builder Pattern

The **Builder** design pattern is one of the **creational** design patterns. It is used in scenarios where the creation of an object becomes complex. You want to keep the **immutability** of an object and at the same time, be able to create the object with different set of attributes on different kinds of scenarios.

## Decorator Pattern

The **decorator** pattern is a structural design pattern. The main intent of the pattern is to attach additional responsibility to an object dynamically. It is an alternative to subclassing. It solves the problem of adding functionalities to a class without adding concrete changes to that class.

## Facade Pattern

The **facade** pattern is a **structural** design pattern. The main intent of the pattern is to provide a unified interface instead of exposing a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a high-level interface that makes the underlying services easier to use.


## Flyweight Pattern

The **flyweight** design pattern is a **structural** design pattern. The main intent of this design pattern is to use sharing to support large number of fine grained objects efficiently.

## Chain Of Responsibility

The **Chain of Responsibility** pattern is a **Behavioral** design pattern. The main intent of the pattern is to avoid coupling between the sender of a request and its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request.
